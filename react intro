const App = () => {#This defines a functional component named App.The const App = () => {} syntax uses arrow functions, which is a modern way to declare functions in JavaScript.
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;#This exports the App component, so it can be used in other files (like index.js).Without this, the component cannot be imported and displayed in your React app
