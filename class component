#typing "rcc" gives basic class template

import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
# This imports the React library, which is required to use JSX (<div>, <h2>, etc.).
# It also imports `Component`, which allows us to create a class-based component.
 export default class App extends Component {
# This defines a class-based React component named `App`, which extends the `Component` class from React.
# In class-based components, we must extend `Component` to get access to features like `state` and `lifecycle methods`.
  state = {
    name: "shiva reddy"
  }
# This initializes a state object inside the component.
# The `state` contains a key-value pair (`name: "shiva reddy"`), which stores the component’s data.
# Unlike functional components, state is managed directly inside class components.

    render() {
# The `render()` method is required in class-based components.
# It determines what gets displayed on the screen.

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Hello {this.state.name}</h2>    
      </div>
    )
# This returns JSX, which defines the UI.
# `<div>` is a wrapper element, and inside it, `<h2>` displays a greeting message.
# `{this.state.name}` dynamically fetches the `name` value from the component’s state and displays it inside the heading.
